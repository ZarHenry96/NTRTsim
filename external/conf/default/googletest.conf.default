# Purpose: Define configuration directives for setup_googletest.sh.
# Date:    2019-11-05
# Usage:   Copy/rename this file to '../googletest.conf' and run setup.sh

# GoogleTest installation prefix

# Global install: /usr/local, env install: "$ENV_DIR"
# By default, setup will download and install GoogleTest under your env directory.
# If you have an existing GoogleTest install, you should change
# GOOGLETEST_INSTALL_PREFIX to what was used for installation (likely /usr/local).
GOOGLETEST_INSTALL_PREFIX="$INSTALL_PREFIX"

# Location where GMockTest is to be built if necessary, or where it was built if
# you're using an existing package. This doesn't need to be set unless gmocktest is
# not already installed.
GOOGLETEST_BUILD_DIR="$ENV_DIR/build/googletest-1.10.0"

# This is the location where you unzipped the package (or, where it will
# be unzipped if necessary).
GOOGLETEST_PACKAGE_DIR="$GOOGLETEST_BUILD_DIR"

# GOOGLETEST_URL can be either a web address or a local file address,
# e.g. http://url.com/for/gmocktest.tgz or file:///path/to/googletest.tgz
GOOGLETEST_URL="https://github.com/google/googletest/archive/release-1.10.0.tar.gz"
